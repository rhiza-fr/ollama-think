First, identify the numbers being added: 2 and 3. Next, add the units place: 0 (from 2) + 3 = 3. Since there are no remaining digits to carry over from either number, the total sum is simply 5. So, 2 + 3 equals \\boxed{5}.\":\n    \n    2\n     \n  \n    \n  \n     \n  \n  \n      \n  \n    \n\n  \n \n    \n     \n  \n     \n  \n'"
