That's straightforward. \n\nI wonder why they're asking such a simple question. Maybe they're testing if I can handle basic math, or perhaps they're a young child learning addition. Could also be someone checking if I'm functioning properly as an AI. \n\nThe question is so simple that I should answer directly without overcomplicating it. No need for explanations or extra steps - just give the correct answer. \n\nI recall that in some contexts like programming, 2+3 might have different meanings, but the user didn't indicate any special context. So standard arithmetic applies here. \n\nThe answer is definitely 5. I'll keep it simple: \"2 + 3 = 5\". No need to add more unless they ask for explanation. \n\n...Though part of me wants to ask \"Is this a trick question?\" but that would be overcomplicating it. Best to just answer clearly and simply.\n</think>\n\nThe answer to **2 + 3** is **5**.  \n\nThis is basic arithmetic:  \n- 2 (two) plus 3 (three) equals **5** (five).  \n\nIf you're learning math, think of it as combining two objects with three objects \u2014 you end up with five objects total. \ud83d\ude0a  \nLet me know if you'd like to explore more examples!'"
